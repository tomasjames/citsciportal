Citizen Science Portal
======================

This project contains Agent Exoplanet.

Changes
-------

1. Agent Exoplanet now uses the latest version of Django (Django 1.8).
2. The combined lightcurve (the lightcurve that combines everybody's data) now plots live, rather than the cron-job based system previous builds used.
3. The majority of the computation for the combined lightcurve is now done using numpy arrays for speed.
4. Other miscellaneous optimisations to the code have been made.

Adding a new dataset
--------------------

1. Enter the Django-admin and, under ‘Agent Exoplanet Administration’ locate ‘Transit events’ and click to enter.
2. In the top right, select ‘Add new event’.
3. Populate the details (all are required). NOTE: FOR NOW LET THE FINDER ID BE ANY NUMBER NOT ALREADY ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER DATASET (1 is a good choice for now).
4. Repeat 3. for ‘Transit targets’.
5. Run `python manage.py shell` in a terminal window in the root folder of the project. This will open a Python shell.
6. Run `from agentex.models import Event, Target` and then `planet_name = Event.objects.filter(event=‘planet_name’)` where `planet_name` is the name given to the event in 3..
7. Run `planet_name.event`
5. In a Terminal window, run `python manage.py loadplanetdata`.
